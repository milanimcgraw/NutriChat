# ü§ñ Nutrition Facts Chat Assistant

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Overview

The Nutrition Facts Chat Assistant is an advanced, AI-powered application that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and contextual nutritional information. This project demonstrates the practical application of cutting-edge natural language processing techniques in the field of nutrition and dietary information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **RAG-based Information Retrieval**: Utilizes a sophisticated RAG system to fetch and generate relevant nutritional information from a comprehensive database.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Offers a user-friendly interface for querying nutritional information, built with Streamlit for seamless interaction.
- **High-Accuracy Responses**: Employs state-of-the-art language models to ensure accurate and contextually appropriate answers to nutritional queries.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Implements rigorous evaluation metrics including cosine similarity and LLM-as-a-judge to assess the quality of generated responses.
- **Data Visualization**: Features insightful visualizations of system performance and nutritional data distributions.
- **Automated Data Ingestion**: Includes a robust pipeline for ingesting and processing new nutritional data, ensuring the system stays up-to-date.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides a dashboard for monitoring system performance and user interactions in real-time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Sentence Transformers**: For text embedding and similarity calculations
- **OpenAI GPT Models**: For generating human-like responses and evaluations
- **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and processing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web interface and monitoring dashboard

## ‚öôÔ∏è Evaluation and Metrics

This project employs a two-pronged approach to evaluate the performance of the chat assistant:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between the generated answers and the ground truth from our nutrition database.
2. **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Utilizes a language model to provide a qualitative assessment of the generated answers, classifying them as RELEVANT, PARTLY_RELEVANT, or NON_RELEVANT.
